//The CHGame part of Platform.h, included by it. See "The device" in Platform.h for what this
//supplies, the functions are in PlatformCHGame.cpp.
//
//The CHGame is Kevin Bates' handheld around a WCH CH32X035G8U6: a QingKe V4C (RISC-V, 48 MHz)
//with 62 KB of flash, of which the USB bootloader keeps the first 12 KB and the game gets
//50944 bytes, 20464 bytes of RAM and a 128x128 ST7735S on SPI1. The board package is
//github.com/bateske/CH32SerialBoot, the display numbers below come from its own graphics
//library github.com/bateske/CHGfx, which is what this panel is known to like.
//
//The game's screen is 128x128 and so is the display, so the picture fills it exactly and there
//is no border to keep black, unlike the Gamebuino META this is otherwise modelled on. Neither
//LovyanGFX nor TFT_eSPI builds on this core, so the display class is a small one of its own
//below, offering the LovyanGFX calls the game makes the way LovyanGFX takes them, so the game's
//LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged.

//Where drawing goes, the modes are described in PlatformESPboy.h. 20464 bytes of RAM leave room
//for 0 (straight to the display) or a 1 bpp buffer, which is 2048 bytes. An 8 bpp buffer would be
//16384 of the 20464 and leave nothing for the stack, the heap and the SD card, so it is not
//offered. A build can still set this itself

//one bit a pixel rather than kept as RGB565, which comes to 689 bytes where the default skin's

//parts where the busiest level of any pack is 222 and most packs are under 100, and asking for the
//402 left no room for the pool at all: every level came up empty. 2 slots over, as elsewhere.

//a scrolling frame, and the floodfill itself ran every frame whether anything moved or not, which
//was more than half the cost of a still one. Leaving it out also hands back the floodfill's
//bitmaps and its tile stack, which this device wants for the level. A build can still ask for it

//The pixel loops are put in ram rather than run from flash. The core fetches from flash with wait
//states and does not guess at branches, so a short loop with a test in it runs several times slower
//there: the byte swap in writePixels costs about 9 cycles a pixel while the same loops cost 60 to
//110 from flash, for work that is not much different. There is no .highcode section in this board's
//linker script, but .data is loaded into ram from flash at startup, so a function put there is
//copied with it and runs from ram. noinline as well, or a static loop called from one place is
//folded into its caller and lands back in flash with it, the section asking for nothing. Only the
//innermost loops are marked, the ram is needed for the level
