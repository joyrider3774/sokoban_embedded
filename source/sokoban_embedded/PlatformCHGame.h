//The CHGame part of Platform.h, included by it. See "The device" in Platform.h for what this
//supplies, the functions are in PlatformCHGame.cpp.
//
//The CHGame is Kevin Bates' handheld around a WCH CH32X035G8U6: a QingKe V4C (RISC-V, 48 MHz)
//with 62 KB of flash, of which the USB bootloader keeps the first 12 KB and the game gets
//50944 bytes, 20464 bytes of RAM and a 128x128 ST7735S on SPI1. The board package is
//github.com/bateske/CHGame (0.3.0 or later), the display numbers below come from its own graphics
//library github.com/bateske/CHGfx, which is what this panel is known to like.
//
//The game's screen is 128x128 and so is the display, so the picture fills it exactly and there
//is no border to keep black, unlike the Gamebuino META this is otherwise modelled on. Neither
//LovyanGFX nor TFT_eSPI builds on this core, so the display class is a small one of its own
//below, offering the LovyanGFX calls the game makes the way LovyanGFX takes them, so the game's
//LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged.

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <string.h>

//the display class offers LovyanGFX's calls, so the game takes its LovyanGFX drawing paths

//Platform_Exit goes back to the SD game menu: a reset without a boot request, which the
//bootloader with the menu (platform/bootloader in github.com/bateske/CHGame) answers with its
//menu. START held for 3 seconds calls it, see Platform_GetButtons
#define PLATFORM_HAS_EXIT 1

//Where drawing goes, the modes are described in PlatformESPboy.h. 20464 bytes of RAM leave room
//for 0 (straight to the display) or a 1 bpp buffer, which is 2048 bytes. An 8 bpp buffer would be
//16384 of the 20464 and leave nothing for the stack, the heap and the SD card, so it is not
//offered. A build can still set this itself
//There is a card slot on this board, and this device reads its art off it rather than carrying
//it in flash: every skin in full RGB565 instead of the one reduced skin that fits. See CARDIMAGES
//in defines.h and the card file tools/mkcard.py writes.
//Set here and not only by the build, so the Arduino IDE builds the same thing; -DCARDIMAGES=0
//builds the old flash version. It has to be settled here, before the switches below that ask it

//same 18416 bytes the heap does, and this game's levels leave plenty of it: 4592 bytes of heap
//are still free in a level with this.
//2816 holds the whole of a skin - the box, floor, spot and wall sheets a board is made of come
//to 640 bytes and the player is 2048 - so once a board has been drawn once nothing of it is
//read off the card again. Only the title screen, which is 32768 bytes, stays off it

//No multi-block card reads here, see CARD_MULTIBLOCK in PlatformCHGame.cpp. They are worth
//having - several blocks in one command is close to nine times faster a block than a command
//each - but they cost about 884 bytes of flash and this game has not got them: its binaries
//carry the level packs and sit at 98% of the 50944 bytes. Turn this back on with anything

//parts where the busiest level of any pack is 222 and most packs are under 100, and asking for the
//402 left no room for the pool at all: every level came up empty. 2 slots over, as elsewhere.

//bitmaps and its tile stack, which this device wants for the level. A build can still ask for it

//The pixel loops are put in ram rather than run from flash. The core fetches from flash with wait
//states and does not guess at branches, so a short loop with a test in it runs several times slower
//there: the byte swap in writePixels costs about 9 cycles a pixel while the same loops cost 60 to
//110 from flash, for work that is not much different. There is no .highcode section in this board's
//linker script, but .data is loaded into ram from flash at startup, so a function put there is
//copied with it and runs from ram. noinline as well, or a static loop called from one place is
//folded into its caller and lands back in flash with it, the section asking for nothing. Only the
//innermost loops are marked, the ram is needed for the level
